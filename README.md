# Powerball - AngularJS
So.. I bought over 60 tickets for the 1/13/2016 Powerball drawing of $1.5 billion and then quickly realized how am I going to go through 60+ tickets quickly. Well, AngularJS and Underscore are cool, why not invest a little into my learning and see what I can kick out in 2 hours. With a little bit of pair-programming with @sean-perkins due to time, we wiped this bad boy up.
